        <h1> Why Machiavelli sucks</h1>
<p> Machiavelli is an inherently flawed person. 
    He always paces around the room, distracting people but never saying anything.
    He's basically an alchaholic, trying to get everyone to drink with him.
    His famous last words were "Bartender, another Manhattan!"
    After this, he was promptly cancelled from the history happenings podcast for being an alchaholic,
    and commited suicide a few hours later.

        Look at his stupid face, you know you want to punch Machiavelli right between the eyes.
        This idgit even lost the science fair <strong> AND </strong> his piano competition to some rando steven.
